                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-5"><strong>A little back story...</strong></h4>
                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">When I got started in this industry, some people tried to low ball me because I was just another regular photo/video guy. So despite the quality of my work, sometimes I had to negotiate my rates with some clients because beside everything else I had to make money so I could keep up with my bills. At some point, I was working like a slave taking all kinds of gigs, spending 100 hours a week between shooting and editing, I was barely sleeping. <br><br>I eventually burnt out and got really sick after a couple months doing that. The money I was making was not even worth the work I was putting in so I decided to take a break, take care of my health, slowly work on my craft, invest in my personal brand to become the best version of myself and come back with a better strategy. My goal then was to work less and charge more money but the question was, how was I gonna do it? I took some time to think about it and I eventually came up with a better plan.<br><br>I started looking into other creatives that were doing the same thing as me and getting paid thousands of dollars for a single gig for the same quality. What were they doing different? Well, I realized that either they already have built a big following or have an outstanding portfolio which gives them the privilege to charge high prices or they have access to a network that other people don’t have access to. It was all about the connections they have. But at the time, building a big following was not an option for me, It was gonna take too long. <br><br>I wanted to fast track the process so I had to figure out a way to access a network of people that could help me reach my goal. Well I didn't waste no time, I started networking like crazy, reaching out to the people I believed could make things happen. I was determined to take my business to the next level so I revamped all my social media platforms for a cleaner look, started posting some of my best works and focused on working on bettering my personal brand. <br><br>A week later I got to connect through Instagram DM with a PR Agent that works with big magazines and celebrities. She really loved my work and gave me the opportunity to work on a video project with an uprising artist. I then thought to myself “ that was it! ”. I knew I had to deliver my best work and that’s exactly what I did. They loved the video I produced and that was the beginning of an amazing journey. From that project, I offered her to shoot some BTS videos for free for her upcoming Magazine Cover Shoots with Celebrities or other celebrities projects. My goal here was to create high quality cinematic BTS videos. She accepted and from there I got to work with dozens of other Celebrities, actors, actresses, music artists and  influencers with millions of followers like former miss universe Zuleyka Rivera (2.2m), Marjorie de Sousa (7.5m), Juju (3.1m), DreamDoll (4.4m), Arrogant Tae (2.4m), Ariadna Gutiérrez (3.4m) Anthony Hamilton (1m), KJ Smith (402k), Emily Tosta (272k), Rosa Acosta (1.6m), Leli Hernandez (1m) and many more that are constantly featured in Big Magazines. <br><br>The best thing about all this was, being able to exponentially expand my network, I got to travel around the country, meet, work and build relationships with some amazing and talented people on set, from photographers, videographers, creative directors, to makeup artists, hair stylists, nails technicians, wardrobe stylists, Pr agents, producers who also work with celebrities.<br><br>My life has completely changed, I work less now and I’m able to easily attract high paying projects because I was able to build a portfolio that gave me the leverage to price my services the way I want it. As you might already understand, the whole point of my strategy was to get access to and work with successful people with huge following, then build a portfolio that I will showcase to a new clientele that will be willing to pay me big bucks to work with them. Does that make sense to you?<br><br>It took me a while to figure all this out, a lot of ups and downs and expensive investments to get to where I am today but I’m grateful for the journey and all the opportunities I have had along the way.<br><br><br>In this book I will give you the tips and tricks, show you the techniques that I used to get access to and work with a network of celebrities and how you can leverage that opportunity to easily attract your dream clientele and make more money.<br><br>YOU CAN DO THE SAME TOO, WITHOUT<br><br>Where to start<br>The steps you have to take before getting the ball rolling. The more prepared you are, the better chances you have to make a best first impression<br><br><br>1 to connect with the right people and network like a pro<br><br>In this section, I will show exactly where and how to find the key people that you need to get the process started. You will learn how to become a beast at networking, I will provide you with messages/email templates proven to work that you can use to catch their attention and break the ice.<br><br>What to do when you get your first important gig<br><br>Learn how to prepare yourself before the gig.
